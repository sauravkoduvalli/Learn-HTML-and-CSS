### What is JavaSctipt?

`JavaScript` is a high-level, interpreted, and multi-paradigm programming language, originally created by _Brendan Eich_ in _1995_, primarily to make web pages interactive. Over time, it has evolved into a powerful, general-purpose language used across the entire software stack — from browsers (frontend) to servers (via `Node.js`) and even mobile and desktop applications.

It’s one of the three core technologies of the web — alongside `HTML` (structure) and `CSS` (presentation) — and serves as the logic layer that enables interactivity, dynamic updates, and asynchronous data handling.

### Is JavaScript interpreted or compiled language?

JavaScript is primarily considered an interpreted language, but modern JavaScript engines also utilize _Just-In-Time (JIT)_ compilation for performance optimization.

**Interpreted Aspect**: Traditionally, JavaScript code is executed line by line by an interpreter within a runtime environment, such as a web browser or Node.js. This means the code is not fully translated into machine code before execution begins.

**JIT Compilation Aspect**: Modern JavaScript engines, like Google's V8 engine, employ JIT compilation. This process involves converting parts of the JavaScript code into optimized machine code during runtime, just before it's executed. This dynamic compilation significantly improves performance, especially for frequently executed code sections.

Therefore, while JavaScript retains its interpreted nature, the inclusion of JIT compilation in its execution environment makes it a hybrid in practice, blending aspects of both interpretation and compilation to achieve efficient execution.
